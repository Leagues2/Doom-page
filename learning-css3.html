            <p>
                In the days before man first spoke, an immense shard of rock and metal was cast unto the world from the
                heavens. Thunder and cataclysm shook the land as the skies were torn asunder. The Cosmic Spear cleft a
                hole through our mortal lands, pole to pole, from the cold wastes of the Umbral Plains to the fetid
                swamps of Ironfang. The Womb of the World opened and the Elemental Wraiths, the Firstborn, spilled
                forth. They took to the skies, fierce in their emancipation. In their exultation, they brought vitality
                to the land, and all that felt their breath were awakened by eternal slumber. Fierce beasts and an
                unforgiving biosphere rose in the passing of their shadow as the Wraithcall echoed across Argent D'Nur.
            </p>
            <p>
                First came the Ancestrals, feral creatures invigorated by the magic of the Wraiths. They grew to
                enormous heights, mighty behemoths who waged war with each other for years untold. Their battles tore
                the land asunder and destroyed all creation caught in their wake. The Wraithcall continued to spread
                across the land and soon the Argenta emerged from the steppes, our souls stirred into form by the power
                of their breath.
            </p>
            <p>
                The titans towered over the wild-blooded tribes but found them uncowed. The Secret of the Sword was
                discovered, and in the darkness of sweltering mountain-forges, we beat steel until it was strong enough
                to pierce bone and sever flesh.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus we came to be; born of rock and fire, lowly in birth but risen by the strength of our will. By the
                blessedness of the First Ones, we forged sword and shield and took the hammer to the Ancestrals. We
                claimed dominion of creation by right of blood and magick, and the Time of Man came to be.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the Ancestral beasts driven back to their bleak valleys, we rose. We tilled the fertile land,
                husbanded beasts of burden, and built towering cities. In the Hallowed Palace, on the Obsidian Throne,
                we crowned King Ormero the Father, the first of the line that shall weigh in perpetuity. We built the
                Cathedral of Reflection to worship the First Ones and formed the Order of the Deag, whose priests pay
                tribute to the Wraiths and appease their tempestuous hunger. Our sons and daughters chose the path of
                the sword or the path of the alchemist, for each duty honors the Gods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though our ways were righteous, we were not without strife - storms and great quakes cast our spires
                down, barbaric tribes laid siege to our fields in search of the great gifts mother Argenta has bestowed
                upon our work, and the song of the Wraithcall threatened to drive lesser men into madness. We were not
                lesser men. We defended that which the First Ones gifted to us, our lands and right to the bounty held
                within. We beat back the barbarian hordes and hardened our resolve. We rose above the fire, our bodies
                and souls tempered, and an unbreakable will was shaped in the forge of battle. What emerged was the
                heart of our legion - the order of the Night Sentinels.
